windu
=====

A set of C++11 headers to do histogramming and looping over arbitrarily defined events. 
Histograms are written to xml files, which can easily be read in by eg. matplotlib. Developed for high energy physics.

Installation is easy, as the package consists only of header files. Just tell your compiler where to find them
A common Makefile is included in the windu directory, and an example Makefile in the sample project.
